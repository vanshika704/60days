🐧 Linux Commands (DevOps – 2)

cat, less, tail, grep, find

1️⃣ cat — View & combine files
🔹 What does cat do?

cat stands for concatenate.
It is mainly used to:

Display file content

Combine files

Create small files

✅ Syntax
cat filename

🔹 Examples

View file content:

cat file.txt


View multiple files:

cat file1.txt file2.txt


Create a file:

cat > notes.txt
Hello Linux
Ctrl + D


Append to a file:

cat >> notes.txt
More text
Ctrl + D

⚠️ Limitation

❌ Not good for large files (dumps everything at once)

2️⃣ less — View large files safely
🔹 What does less do?

less lets you:

View large files page by page

Scroll up/down

Search inside file

📌 Preferred over cat for logs.

✅ Syntax
less filename

🔹 Useful keys inside less
Key	Action
Space	Next page
b	Previous page
/word	Search
n	Next match
q	Quit
🔹 Example
less server.log

3️⃣ tail — View end of file (logs ⭐)
🔹 What does tail do?

Displays the last lines of a file.

📌 Mostly used for log monitoring.

✅ Syntax
tail filename

🔹 Examples

Last 10 lines (default):

tail app.log


Last 20 lines:

tail -n 20 app.log


Live log monitoring:

tail -f app.log


📌 -f = follow (real-time updates)

4️⃣ grep — Search text inside files
🔹 What does grep do?

Searches for patterns/words in files.

📌 Extremely important for DevOps.

✅ Syntax
grep "pattern" filename

🔹 Examples

Search word:

grep "ERROR" app.log


Case-insensitive search:

grep -i "error" app.log


Search in multiple files:

grep "ERROR" *.log


Show line numbers:

grep -n "ERROR" app.log

🔥 grep with pipes (REAL DEVOPS)
tail -f app.log | grep "ERROR"

5️⃣ find — Search files/directories
🔹 What does find do?

Finds files and directories based on:

Name

Type

Size

Time

Permissions

✅ Syntax
find path condition

🔹 Examples

Find file by name:

find /home -name "file.txt"


Case-insensitive:

find /home -iname "File.txt"


Find only directories:

find . -type d


Find only files:

find . -type f


Find files larger than 100MB:

find . -size +100M

🔥 find + grep (INTERVIEW GOLD)
find /var/log -name "*.log" | grep "app"

🧠 COMMAND COMPARISON (EXAM QUICK VIEW)

❗ COMMON MISTAKES

Using cat for huge files

Forgetting quotes in grep

Confusing find with grep

Using relative path wrongly in find
