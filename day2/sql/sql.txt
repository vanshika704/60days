📊 SQL FILTERING OPERATORS

IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL

Assume a table:

EMPLOYEE
--------------------------------
emp_id | name | salary | dept | email
--------------------------------
1      | Asha | 30000  | HR   | asha@gmail.com
2      | Ravi | 45000  | IT   | NULL
3      | Neha | 60000  | IT   | neha@company.com
4      | Amit | 52000  | FIN  | NULL
5      | Pooja| 40000  | HR   | pooja@yahoo.com

1️⃣ IN — Multiple values filter
🔹 What is IN?

IN is used to check whether a column value matches any value in a given list.

📌 Replacement for multiple OR conditions.

✅ Syntax
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE column IN (value1, value2, ...);

🔹 Example

Employees working in HR or IT:

SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE dept IN ('HR', 'IT');


✔ Same as:

WHERE dept = 'HR' OR dept = 'IT'

❌ Common mistake
WHERE dept = ('HR','IT');  -- WRONG

2️⃣ BETWEEN — Range filter
🔹 What is BETWEEN?

BETWEEN selects values within a given range (inclusive).

📌 Includes start and end values.

✅ Syntax
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE column BETWEEN low AND high;

🔹 Example

Employees with salary between 40,000 and 55,000:

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 55000;


✔ Includes 40000 and 55000

🔹 BETWEEN with dates
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE joining_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

❌ Common mistake
WHERE salary BETWEEN 55000 AND 40000; -- WRONG order

3️⃣ LIKE — Pattern matching
🔹 What is LIKE?

LIKE is used for pattern matching in strings.

Uses wildcards.

🔑 Wildcards
Symbol	Meaning
%	Any number of characters
_	Exactly one character
🔹 Examples

🔹 Names starting with 'A':

SELECT * 
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';


🔹 Names ending with 'a':

WHERE name LIKE '%a';


🔹 Names containing 'mi':

WHERE name LIKE '%mi%';


🔹 Exactly 5-letter names:

WHERE name LIKE '_____';

❌ Common mistake
WHERE name = '%A%';  -- WRONG

4️⃣ IS NULL — Checking NULL values
🔹 What is NULL?

NULL means missing or unknown value
It is not equal to 0 or empty string.

🔹 Why NOT = NULL?

Because NULL is not comparable using =.

❌ WRONG:

WHERE email = NULL;

✅ Correct way
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE email IS NULL;

🔹 NOT NULL
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;

🔥 COMBINED EXAMPLES (VERY IMPORTANT)

Employees from IT dept, salary between 40k–60k, email missing:

SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE dept = 'IT'
  AND salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000
  AND email IS NULL;

🧠 INTERVIEW ONE-LINERS

IN → checks multiple values

BETWEEN → range (inclusive)

LIKE → pattern matching

IS NULL → checks missing values

⚠️ MOST COMMON EXAM MISTAKES

Using = NULL

Forgetting % in LIKE

Thinking BETWEEN is exclusive

Wrong order in BETWEEN
