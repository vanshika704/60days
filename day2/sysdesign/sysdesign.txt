🏗️ System Design (Day 2 – Core Foundations)
1️⃣ Client–Server Architecture
🔹 What is it?

A client requests services/resources.
A server processes the request and sends back a response.

Client  →  Request  →  Server
Client  ←  Response ←  Server

🔹 Examples

Browser (client) → Web Server

Mobile App → Backend API

Postman → REST API

🔹 Responsibilities

Client

UI

Input validation

Sends requests

Server

Business logic

Authentication

Database access

🔹 Types

2-tier: Client ↔ Server

3-tier: Client ↔ Server ↔ Database

N-tier: Microservices

✅ Pros

Centralized logic

Easy maintenance

Secure data storage

❌ Cons

Server bottleneck

Network dependency

2️⃣ Request–Response Lifecycle (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔁 Step-by-step flow

Client sends request (HTTP)

Request reaches Load Balancer (optional)

Server receives request

Authentication & validation

Business logic execution

Database access

Server creates response

Response sent back to client

Client → LB → Server → DB
Client ← LB ← Server ← DB

🔹 Example (GET request)
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com


Server returns:

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Vanshika"
}

🔹 Key Interview Point

📌 Latency = Network + Processing + DB time

3️⃣ REST vs RPC
🔵 REST (Representational State Transfer)

Resource-based

Uses HTTP methods

Stateless

Example
GET /users/1
POST /users
PUT /users/1
DELETE /users/1

🔴 RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

Action-based

Calls functions remotely

Feels like local function call

Example
getUser(id=1)
createUser(name="A")

🆚 REST vs RPC (TABLE)
Feature	REST	RPC
Style	Resource-based	Action-based
URL	Nouns	Verbs
HTTP methods	Yes	Usually POST
Readability	High	Lower
Coupling	Loose	Tight
Caching	Easy	Hard

📌 gRPC = modern RPC using HTTP/2 + Protobuf

🔑 Interview Verdict

Public APIs → REST

Internal microservices → gRPC

4️⃣ Stateless vs Stateful Systems 🔥
🟢 Stateless System

Server does not store client state.

Each request is independent

Session stored on client (JWT, cookies)

Example

REST APIs

JWT authentication

Request 1 → Server (no memory)
Request 2 → Server (no memory)

🟢 Pros

Easy scaling

Load balancing friendly

Fault tolerant

🔴 Cons

Larger request size

Client responsibility

🔴 Stateful System

Server remembers client state.

Session stored on server

Depends on previous requests

Example

Traditional login sessions

WebSockets

Request → Server (session memory)

🔴 Pros

Faster access

Less client data

❌ Cons

Hard to scale

Sticky sessions needed

🆚 Comparison
Feature	Stateless	Stateful
Server memory	❌	✅
Scalability	High	Low
Fault tolerance	High	Low
Load balancing	Easy	Hard
🧠 Interview One-Liners

Client-server separates UI from logic.

Request–response is the core web communication model.

REST is resource-oriented, RPC is action-oriented.

Stateless systems scale better.

Stateful systems store session data on server.

🔥 Common Interview Traps

Saying REST uses only GET/POST ❌

Mixing stateless with no authentication ❌

Thinking RPC is outdated ❌
