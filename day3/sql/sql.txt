📊 SQL: ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET
1️⃣ ORDER BY (ASC / DESC)
🔹 Purpose

Used to sort query results.

🔹 Syntax
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;

🔹 Default Order
ORDER BY column_name


➡ Defaults to ASC (ascending)

✅ Example

Table: Employees

id	name	salary
1	A	50000
2	B	70000
3	C	60000
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;


📤 Output:

B 70000
C 60000
A 50000

🔹 Multiple Columns Sorting
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;


➡ Sort by department first, then salary inside department.

2️⃣ LIMIT
🔹 Purpose

Restricts number of rows returned.

🔹 Syntax (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
SELECT *
FROM table
LIMIT 5;


➡ Returns first 5 rows

✅ Example
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;


➡ Top 3 highest paid employees

3️⃣ OFFSET
🔹 Purpose

Skips number of rows before returning results
(used for pagination)

🔹 Syntax
SELECT *
FROM table
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;


➡ Skip first 10 rows, return next 5

📄 Pagination Example

Page size = 5

Page	Query
Page 1	LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0
Page 2	LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5
Page 3	LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10
🔹 ORDER BY + LIMIT + OFFSET (Most Used Combo)
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;


➡ 6th–10th highest salaries

🔹 Execution Order (VERY IMPORTANT ⚠️)
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
LIMIT / OFFSET


➡ You cannot use column alias in WHERE
➡ You can use alias in ORDER BY

🔹 Interview Traps ⚠️
❌ Without ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM Employees LIMIT 5;


🚫 Result is not guaranteed

✔ Always use ORDER BY with LIMIT

❌ OFFSET on Large Tables

OFFSET becomes slow for big datasets.

✔ Use keyset pagination instead:

WHERE id > last_seen_id
LIMIT 5;

🔹 DB-Specific Syntax Differences
Database	Syntax
MySQL / PostgreSQL	LIMIT x OFFSET y
MySQL alt	LIMIT y, x
SQL Server	OFFSET y ROWS FETCH NEXT x ROWS ONLY
Oracle	FETCH FIRST x ROWS ONLY
🎯 Interview One-Liners

ORDER BY sorts result set

LIMIT restricts number of rows

OFFSET skips rows (pagination)

OFFSET is expensive for large data

LIMIT without ORDER BY is unsafe
