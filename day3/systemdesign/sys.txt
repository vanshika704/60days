🏗️ System Design (Day 3)
Scalability Basics • Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling • Bottlenecks
1️⃣ What is Scalability?
🔹 Definition

Scalability is a system’s ability to handle increased load by adding resources without breaking performance.

Load can be:

More users

More requests/sec

More data

More traffic

🔹 Two Types

Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

2️⃣ Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
🔹 What It Is

Increase power of a single machine:

More CPU

More RAM

Faster disk

✅ Example

Upgrade server from 8GB → 64GB RAM

Move DB to larger instance

👍 Pros

✔ Easy to implement
✔ No code changes
✔ Good for early-stage systems

👎 Cons

❌ Hardware limit
❌ Single Point of Failure
❌ Expensive
❌ Downtime during upgrade

🧠 Interview Line

Vertical scaling is simple but limited and not fault-tolerant.

3️⃣ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
🔹 What It Is

Add more machines:

Multiple servers

Load balancer in front

✅ Example
Client
  ↓
Load Balancer
  ↓
Server 1
Server 2
Server 3

👍 Pros

✔ Highly scalable
✔ Fault tolerant
✔ No upper limit (theoretically)
✔ Industry standard

👎 Cons

❌ Complex design
❌ Needs stateless services
❌ Data consistency challenges

🧠 Interview Line

Horizontal scaling is complex but provides reliability and high availability.

4️⃣ Vertical vs Horizontal (FAANG Table)
Feature	Vertical	Horizontal
Add resources	Bigger machine	More machines
Cost	High	Flexible
Fault tolerance	❌ No	✅ Yes
Downtime	Yes	No
Scalability limit	Hardware bound	Practically unlimited
Used by	Small apps	Large-scale systems
5️⃣ Common Scalability Bottlenecks ⚠️
🔥 1. Database Bottleneck

Too many reads/writes

Single DB instance

Fix:

Read replicas

Caching (Redis)

Sharding

🔥 2. Application Server Bottleneck

CPU-bound logic

Too many synchronous calls

Fix:

Horizontal scaling

Async processing

Microservices

🔥 3. Network Bottleneck

Large payloads

Chatty APIs

Fix:

Compression

CDN

Batching

🔥 4. Disk / Storage Bottleneck

Slow disk I/O

Logs growing fast

Fix:

SSDs

Distributed storage

Log rotation

🔥 5. Cache Miss Bottleneck

Cache not used properly

Fix:

Cache hot data

Proper TTL

Cache-aside pattern

6️⃣ Stateless vs Stateful (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 Stateless Services

No user data stored in server memory

Required for horizontal scaling

✔ Store session in:

Redis

JWT

🔹 Stateful = Scaling Nightmare

❌ Sticky sessions
❌ Hard failover

7️⃣ Real Interview Example
❓ “Your service is slow. What do you do?”

Answer Structure:

Identify bottleneck (CPU, DB, network)

Apply vertical scaling temporarily

Move to horizontal scaling

Add caching

Optimize DB

🎯 Interview One-Liners (Memorize)

Scalability ≠ performance

Vertical scaling is limited

Horizontal scaling is industry standard

Databases are common bottlenecks

Stateless services enable scale

🧠 Golden Rule

Scale reads with caching, scale writes with sharding.
