📊 SQL FOUNDATIONS
1️⃣ SELECT Clause
🔹 Purpose

Used to retrieve columns from a table.

📌 Syntax
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;

🧠 Example
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees;


👉 Retrieves only name and salary.

2️⃣ DISTINCT
🔹 Purpose

Removes duplicate values from result set.

📌 Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;

🧠 Example
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;


📌 Applies to all selected columns together, not individually.

❌ Trap:

SELECT DISTINCT department, salary
FROM employees;


→ Distinct is applied on (department, salary) pair.

3️⃣ WHERE Clause
🔹 Purpose

Filters rows based on conditions.

📌 Syntax
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

🧠 Example
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

4️⃣ AND / OR / NOT
🔹 AND

All conditions must be true.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 60000;

🔹 OR

Any one condition true.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance';

🔹 NOT

Negates condition.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'HR';

⚠️ Operator Precedence (VERY IMPORTANT)
Priority:

NOT

AND

OR

❌ Wrong assumption:

WHERE A OR B AND C


✔ Actual meaning:

WHERE A OR (B AND C)


✔ Always use parentheses:

WHERE (A OR B) AND C;

🔁 Query Execution Order (CRITICAL 🔥)

SQL is NOT executed in the order we write it.

✅ ACTUAL EXECUTION ORDER
1️⃣ FROM
2️⃣ WHERE
3️⃣ SELECT

🧠 Explanation

FROM → identifies the table

WHERE → filters rows

SELECT → chooses columns

📌 Example
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;

Execution:

FROM employees → load table

WHERE salary > 50000 → filter rows

SELECT name, salary → show columns

⚠️ WHY THIS MATTERS (INTERVIEW TRAP)

❌ This fails:

SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM employees
WHERE annual_salary > 600000;

❌ Reason

WHERE executes before SELECT, so alias doesn’t exist yet.

✔ Correct Way (Using subquery)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT salary * 12 AS annual_salary
    FROM employees
) t
WHERE annual_salary > 600000;

🧠 Common Mistakes Summary
Mistake	Why
Using alias in WHERE	Alias created after WHERE
Forgetting DISTINCT scope	Works on entire row
Ignoring AND/OR precedence	Logical error
Thinking SQL runs top-down	Wrong execution order
📌 Exam-Ready Definitions

SELECT:

Used to retrieve specific columns from a database table.

DISTINCT:

Eliminates duplicate rows from the result set.

WHERE:

Query Execution Order:

FROM → WHERE → SELECT
