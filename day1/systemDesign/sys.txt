🏗️ System Design (Day 1)
1️⃣ What is System Design?

System Design is the process of planning and designing the architecture of a software system to meet specific functional and non-functional requirements.

🔹 Goals:

Scalability → Handle more users/data

Reliability → System should not fail

Maintainability → Easy to update/extend

Performance → Fast response & low latency

🔹 Example:

Design Twitter feed or WhatsApp messaging system

Decide: databases, servers, APIs, caching, load balancing

2️⃣ HLD vs LLD
Feature	High-Level Design (HLD)	Low-Level Design (LLD)
Scope	Big picture / architecture	Detailed design / code-level
Audience	Architects, Managers	Developers
Components	Modules, Services, DB, APIs	Classes, Functions, Data Structures
Level	Abstract	Concrete / Detailed
Diagram	System Architecture Diagram	Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram
Example	“Use Redis for caching, MySQL for DB”	“Class User {id, name}, Method sendMessage()”

Rule of Thumb: HLD = What, LLD = How

3️⃣ Functional vs Non-functional Requirements
🔹 Functional Requirements (FR)

Describe what system should do

Example:

Users can send messages

Users can like a post

Payment processing

🔹 Non-functional Requirements (NFR)

Describe how system should perform

Example:

Latency < 100ms

99.99% uptime

Can handle 1 million concurrent users

Scalability, Security, Reliability

✅ Interview Tip: Always clarify FR + NFR at the start of system design interview

4️⃣ Capacity Planning Basics
🔹 What is Capacity Planning?

Estimating resources required to support expected system load

Ensures system can scale without failure

🔹 Key Metrics

Traffic → Requests per second (RPS)

Storage → Database size, file storage

Compute → CPU, Memory, Number of servers

Network → Bandwidth requirements

🔹 Steps

Estimate current load (e.g., 10k users/day)

Estimate future growth (e.g., 10% month-over-month)

Calculate resource requirements (servers, DB, caching)

Include redundancy for high availability

🔹 Quick Example: WhatsApp
Component	Load / Planning
Users	2 billion active users
Messages/day	100 billion
DB	Sharded MySQL + Cassandra
Cache	Redis for active conversations
Servers	Distributed across regions, auto-scaling
Network	High bandwidth, low latency (50-100ms)

✅ This is capacity planning + high-level design together

📌 Interview Tips:

Always start with requirements

Draw HLD first, discuss trade-offs

Mention FR + NFR

Include scaling strategy, caching, load balancing

Always justify decisions with numbers
